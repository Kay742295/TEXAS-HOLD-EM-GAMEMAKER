// This is a multiplayer online texa hole'em game based on gamemaker engine. 
// Total project contains 3 parts: server, client and database.
// Server controls the main game logic, including shuffling cards, distributing cards, calculating chips, evaluating hands,etc.
// Client controls what the game looks like, for example, if the color of UI needs to be changed, go to client.
// Glowing point about this project is that a new algorithm to evaluate hand is created, which is 34.1% faster than the traditional algorithm.
